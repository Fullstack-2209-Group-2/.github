## Group Norms

- In the case of disagreement, we voice our opinion and if both sides feel strongly about their perspective, we can move the discussion to the entire group to further discuss and potentially take a vote to solve the matter.

- If frustrated, it is okay to voice said frustration and to take a break to clear our heads.

- Supporting other team mates during difficult parts of the project will be something to be aware of. Asking your team mates how they are dealing with the project? Are they having a hard time with that?

- When merging, have the entire team check the potential merge conflicts.

- Forrest and Andrew are quick help ticket people. While Allyson and Kaylan are slower help ticket people. 

- Before we put in a help ticket, we will make sure to check in with the other pair for assistance if they are available.

- When working with another teammate who has different help ticket preferences, we can meet in the middle on a time frame to request said help ticket.

- Group members (generally) agree that switching the driver position should occur only after a section of code is completed (i.e. good stopping point).

- After Hours Guidelines: COMMUNICATE!
  - Andrew Crow: Always be available after 8:30pm central.
  - Kaylan Thompson: Generally always available.  Slack notifications are on as well.
  
- Daily meetings:
  - First thing in the morning
